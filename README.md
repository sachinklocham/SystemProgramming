# SystemProgramming

This repository is a curated collection of system-level programming projects, experiments, and code snippets covering:

🐧 Linux systems & kernel-adjacent programming

⚙️ RTOS concepts & task-level architecture

🥾 Bootloader fundamentals & bring-up workflows

🧠 Memory, concurrency & performance-oriented code

📚 Reusable low-level C/C++ utilities & examples

The goal is to build a hands-on reference library for systems programming enthusiasts, embedded developers, and learners exploring software close to hardware.
